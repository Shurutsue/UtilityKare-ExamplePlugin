# UtilityKare-ExamplePlugin

This Project contains an example Plugin which uses UtilityKare to create a custom Reagent,
add a custom Reaction (by combining two fluids to create our custom reagent),
adds a localization entry so it displays the correct name of our reagent with the scanner
and modifies the version string to ensure we can only play multiplayer with other people that have the mod as well.
(Would otherwise be an issue with errors left and right if the others don't have the reagent, after all)

Please see Plugin.cs to see how UtilityKare can be used!
